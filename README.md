DevilUtil
=========

A Java game library based around LWJGL and jBox2D. Has helpful classes for game math, graphics, sound, and user interfaces.

Up until now, this has been my personal game library, so the documentation is mostly atrocious. Some of it's not bad.
Either way, feel free to make use of whatever you find in here. I know some of this stuff has been immensely helpful to me.
